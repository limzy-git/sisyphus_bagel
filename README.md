# ***The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.***
This is a repo for my side projects as I learn how to code in Python. I hope this serves as a time capsule for my learning progress.

## **SIDE PROJECTS**
### 1. 🥯 Sourdough Bagels 🥯
### 27/02/2026 ###
  First project I decided to hunker down and complete. I originally wanted to include more things like:  
    - Difficulty settings where harder difficulty includes a text version, increased digits and lesser guesses  
    - A scoreboard where players can earn points; the lesser guess required the more points earned.  
    - A 'store' where players can use the points to buy items to help guessing the more difficult versions. Things can include a max_guess extender.  
  However, even coding the bare basics of the game is difficult. I might revisti this at a later date.

  ### 01/03/2026 ###
  Revisited this project as I felt that it will be incomplete to move on to my next project without seeing the game to its completion. As I wanted a difficulty setting, I decided it will be best to include an Easy and Hard mode. Though the hard mode seems to require more balancing as apparently it is 47x harder than the standard mode:  
    - Included a settings option to allow player to select difficulties  
      - Easy: 15 guesses with only 2 numeric digits  
      - Hard: 7 guesses with 3 digits. Numbers and letters are included  
      - Included letters when checking for improper input in char_check()  
      - Included letters in get_bagel when Hard difficulty is selected  
    .  
    With the difficulty settings included, I can deem the Sourdough Project as completed.

### 2. ♦️♣️♥️♠️ Blackjack ♠️♥️♣️♦️
### 04/03/2026 ###
  For some reason, I though blackjack will be the natural progression for my next project. Building a well-known game is quite an exciting challenge as well as most people have an idea of how blackjack goes.
    - Uploaded the bare basics of blackjack   
    - Current code only flows until the first dealing of cards    
    - Included a check function to see if there's any blackjack (21 points) after the first dealing    
  I am still undecided how visible the cards should be to the player (currently, all hands are visible) as there is the standard version and the more Asian, Chinese New Year version where you can only see your cards.
